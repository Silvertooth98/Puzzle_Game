Conrols:
W - Forward
A - Left
S - Back
D - Right
Spacebar - Jump
E - Interact
P - Pause

Win/Lose Condition:
In order to win, complete the level. To do this, complete the platform puzzle section and
the logic puzzle section. If you do not complete the level witin the given time, you will
lose. Upon losing due to time, you will have to restart the level, so be quick! If you fall
off the platforms into the lava, you will die. Dying will respawn you at the last checkpoint
you received!

Changes From Design Document:
I made some slight map changes, adding a few extra moving platforms to make the level a bit longer, but the level mostly stuck to what
I created within the design. I also made the logic puzzle hint ontop of the entrance to the puzzle, instead of on an opposite wall.
